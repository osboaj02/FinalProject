        In this project, I am going to be making my own calculator. The calculator will have basic functions as well as
        functions that aren't so basic. Demonstrating the tools I have learned with HTML as well as Javascript.

        But...to fully appreciate the modern day calculators, let's take a journey back to some of the first
        that led us to where we are today. First off it started with something called an abacus. This was developed
        by Sumerians and Egyptians around 2000 BC.
